This package is used to simulate the Frequency Hopping signal based on Modulated Wideband Converter in MATLAB.

The package includes:

	- Demo.m
	- eig_r.m
	- FilterDecimate.m
	- FindNonZeroValues.m
	- is_contained.m
	- MixSignal.m
	- RunOMP_Unnormalized.m

Usage: Unzip the package and run Demo.m

The package is based on the following papers.
